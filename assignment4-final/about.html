    <h2>Everybody Needs to See These Good Boys</h2>
    <p>This site was created in order to show off every good boy that is presented to me. If you believe that your dog is a good boy (or girl) then you should absolutely send in pictures of your good boy. That way, when someone is having a bad day, they can come to this site, and look at some good boys to cheer them up. Sincerely, Luke.
